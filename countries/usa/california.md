# California

## Proposition 13
* was passed in 1978
* passed by referendum and thereby added to the state’s constitution
* It so severely constrained property tax in California that numerous municipal government could not adequately perform their most important functions – from garbage collection to schools. 
* As a result, the state government has had to massively subsidize local governments, mostly through income taxes. That in turn has made the state’s own finances unsustainable.

# Proposition 30
* Jerry Brown, the Governor, is trying to overcome a fiscal calamity inflicted on his state 34 years ago.
* he proposes to raise sales tax, and also income tax on households with earnings above $500,000. 
* The emphasis on consumption tax (comparable to the successful Canadian GST and HST) is a good one.
