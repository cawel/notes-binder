# Silver and Slaves

## bases to the colonial infrastructure
* silver
* slaves

## Silver
* Spanish Doubloon, made of silver extracted from mines in the New World
* between 1493 and 1800, Spain and Portugal dominated the extraction of precious metals from the New World
* 85% of the world supply of silver came form the Americas
* 70% of the world's supply of gold came form the Americas
* silver was the oil of the early modern world
* it was the fuel for transforming a world of villages into the interdependent world economy
* the Americas at its heights had 30 active giant silver mines
* Potosi: famous mine of silver

## Mita System
* process of recruiting labor
* form of indentured labor which would be provided by villages on a seasonal or rotational basis to work in the mines
* inheritance of the old Inca era
* it was the 'caciques' (local chieftains in villages) who determined who would work inside the mines

## Slaves
* the vast majority of those who moved to the Americas were not Europeans, but Africans
* hence we should speak about the Africanization of the New World, as opposed to the Europeanization of the New World
* between 1492 and 1776, 6.5 million people migrated from the Old World to the New, and mostly came from Africa
* only 1 million of the 6.5 million were Europeans
* colonization was a deeply coercive process
* estimate of total number of slaves shipped to American shores: around 10 and 12 million Africans

## The end of the slave trade
* 2 causes in the 1840s:
   * illegalization of the traffic of Africans (abolitionist movement)
   * instability within Europe
* it was the exodus of the Irish that would finally lead to the European eclipse of Africans

## The Slaves
* most Africans came from West Africa (e.g. Congo, Angola)
* 40% goes to Brazil
* 30% goes to the Caribbean's
* 4% goes to North America
* fuelling the exodus of Africans was a process of warfare and rivalry within Africa itself
* African prices and traders played an important role as middlemen in this process and unleashed the flow of slaves to the New World
* the indigenous of the Caribbean's were all but wiped out within the first century
* the population was replenished by the importation of African slaves
* work in the plantation for the production of sugar, and later cotton
* the slave trade was a booming business
* Africa which was an important gold exporter, turned into an exporter of people into the New World

## Turning a resource into commodity production
* labor was a commodity for purchase and sale
* sugar was was a commodity for production and sale
* importation of labor for the production of goods for export

## Shift in the balance of powers
* rise of new kingdoms, e.g. Kongo kingdom, that would feed off the flow of humans and of gold outwards 
* and fuel the chronic warfare within Africa, as they competed for territorial spoils
* result was a cycle of ratcheting up the process of extraction from Africa, pushing the slaving frontier ever further into the interior

## Parting words
It was not just institutions, not just commercial arteries, but also a bridge of violence and exploitation that pulled the parts of the Atlantic world together
