# China's Transformation

## Chinese demand for silver
* China bounced back from the Mongol conquest of the 14th century with the creation of the Ming dynasty (1368-1644)
* major importer of silver
* before silver was coming mainly from mines of Japan
* later it came from the supply in the new World (Acapulco, Mexico)
* between 1500 and 1650, 50% of all European imports would be paid for in silver

## Single Whip Method
* the result of an important fiscal tax reform
* it was an effective tax system
* 1581: the empire enrolled the "Single Whip Method": a kind of harmonized land tax payable in silver
* important factor for the consolidation of Ming state formation
* one index of this process was the pace of urbanization
* upper classes could now pay Chinese imports with sliver
* Chinese were fond of Japanese lacquer wares, live turkeys as pets, Antiquities like Tibetan religious texts

## Renovation process
* New Confucianism which advocated self-improvement, moral vigour and self-cultivation through studies
* it helped update policies and practices of a powerful centralized state
* major figure behind this renovation process was Wang Yangming (1472-1529) who taught that each moral virtue was embedded within each person but needed to be cultivated
* it was a strongly individualist and equalitarian philosophy
* the basis of revitalization of Chinese society and the Ming Dynasty
* enormous influential amount of dynamism at the core of the Chinese state, and soon felt at the periphery

## Peculiarities of an agrarian state
* as with India, China was an agrarian aristocracy
* the ability of this regime to negotiate its relationship with outer peripheries are very different from mercantile and commercial empires
* the founder of the Ming dynasty in the 14th century argued that agriculture is the foundation of the nation
* agrarian wealth was important for the underlying health of the regime
* it opened up new lands for settlements in the periphery of China, placing farmers ever further on the frontiers

## Fixation on the south
* market-led movement
* increased opportunities for producing staples would lure framers to these territorial peripheries in the south
* important basis for this activity was the thriving hub of Canton

## Pearl River delta
* mouth of Hong Kong and Macau
* opening up these ports would extend the process of southernization of the Chinese population
* Europeans demands for silk rose and they would thus pump silver into the Chinese system
* between 1550 ad 1645, an average of 100 000 kg/year of silver entered the region

## Destruction of natural ecosystem in South China
* swamps giving way to mulberry trees, rice paddies, hemp
* deployment of irrigation technologies to drain swamps of water
* result: important conversion of Southern China from being a region of biodiversity to a region dominated by crops grown for commercial purposes
* natural ecological systems gave way to agricultural ecosystems
* spell doom for many non-human macro-fauna of the region, e.g. elephants would go extinct, tigers nearly entirely extinct
* phenomenal population increase from 4 million in 1400 to 12 millions 1640

## Under the Ming dynasty, China's economy boomed due to those factors
* more effective tax system
* the expansion of the agrarian frontiers southwards
