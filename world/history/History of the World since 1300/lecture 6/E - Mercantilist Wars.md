# Mercantilist Wars

## Sir Francis Drake
* he makes money off plundering and pillaging Spanish galleons
* piracy was a global system
* the backdrop of the war between England and Spain was the conflict in the Caribbean's

## Mercantilist warfare
* control of territory and sea lanes to defend exclusive privileges
* 3 main theatres in which empires collided: North America, Caribbean, South Asia
* it would culminate as the 7-years war, known as the French and Indian war
* that was really the 1st world war
* result: leave the empires increasingly indebted
* banks are a product of the 19th century
* states had to borrow money from merchants

## Disequilibrium
* wars make money, money makes states, states make wars
* during the 18th century, European wars became increasingly mercantilist. 
* That means countries fought each other as they pursued colonies and the control of trade routes
