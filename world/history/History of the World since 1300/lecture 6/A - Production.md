# Production

## Change in the appropriation of wealth
* wealth was emerging from various sources around the globe, as a result of the increasing specialization of particular societies for the production of commodities for other people's consumption
* no longer did the appropriation of wealth represent the skimming off the surface of what a village was able to produce above and beyond what is needed to survive

## Specialization
* colonies were societies designed to produce commodities for other people's consumption
* flip side: erosion of self-sufficiency
* erosion of the more contained concept of the community
* colonialism disrupted that pattern of development

## Factory
* word which comes from the coast of Africa
* unit of production in which the workers specialize in a single task
* division of labor increases productivity

## Marketplace
* buy what you need to survive (not from local)
* sell to earn revenue

## Globalization: a story of dependency
* from inter-connected world into an inter-dependent world
* society becomes more unequal

## Paradox of dependency
* dependency is growing inequality between people within societies and between societies
* as the world becomes wealthier, it also becomes more unequal
* global inter-dependance
* will give rise of a very powerful class of actors: merchants
