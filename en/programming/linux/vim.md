## Shortcuts I need to remember

^      To the first non-whitespace character of a line.
H      To the first line of the screen.
M      To the middle line of the screen.
L      To the last line of the screen.
C      Change the rest of the current line.
<c-t>  To insert a tab in insert mode
CTRL-[ is equivalent to hitting the Esc ke
x      in NERDTree, this closes the tree you are in


## save as
there are two ways of "SAVE AS" in Vim. Assumed that I'm editing hello.txt.

:w world.txt will write hello.txt's content to the file world.txt while keeping hello.txt as the opened buffer in vim.
:sav world.txt will first write hello.txt's content to the file world.txt, then close buffer hello.txt, finally open world.txt as the current buffer.


## ctags

* <C-]>   To jump to a tag
* <C-t>   To climb back the tree

:ts or :tselect shows the list
:tn or :tnext goes to the next tag in that list
:tp or :tprev goes to the previous tag in that list
:tf or :tfirst goes to the first tag of the list
:tl or :tlast goes to the last tag of the list

If youâ€™re using the Ctrlp plugin for vim, running :CtrlPTag will let you search through your tags file and jump to where tags are defined.
