## President 4 times
* elected president in 1998, his coalition put education, health care and cheap access to basic foods at the forefront of its policies while Chavez made himself accessible to the country’s poorest citizens.
* In the years ahead, Chavez would rewrite the constitution, win re-election in 2000 and extend his term to six years from five years. 
* He would later abolish term limits altogether in a 2009 referendum. 
* Critics said that through his legislative changes and control of the media, Chavez had effectively become a dictator.
* He won re-election 3 times in 12 years.

## Using oil revenues to help the poors
* His anti-U.S. sentiment and wish to regain control of the oil industry led Chavez to tour the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries early in his presidency to seek OPEC’s consensus on boosting the price of crude.
* As prices for Venezuelan crude surged more than 10-fold, to about $126 a barrel in 2008 from less than $9 a barrel when he took office, Chavez began to pour money into social programs, helping to cut the poverty rate by half. 

## Domestic politics
* Chavez radicalized his agenda following a 2002 coup that removed him from power for 48 hours and after a two-month general strike later that year paralyzed oil production. 
* He responded by firing more than 18,000 employees of Petroleos de Venezuela SA, the state oil company, and replacing its board.
* The strike caused the economy to shrink 27 percent in the first quarter of 2003 while unemployment rose to 20 percent.
* Chavez overhauled his economic policies after the strike by installing currency controls and price ceilings on basic goods such as corn meal, beef and milk. 
* He started a nationalization drive that would give the state majority control of almost every industry, a move the sparked shortages of basic goods and inflation of more than 30 percent.

## International relations
* Sanctions that prohibited Chavez from buying military equipment from the U.S. prompted him to turn to Russia, China and Iran as commercial partners. 
* He defended Libyan dictator Muammar Qaddafi as he fought a 2011 rebellion that would take his life and called his alliance with Iran “holy.”
