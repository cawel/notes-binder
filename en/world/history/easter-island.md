## Geography
* Only some 150 square miles in area
* 2,000 miles off the west coast of South America

## Timeline
* Easter Island was colonized by an estimated 20-30 adventurous Polynesians in the 5th century AD
* At its peak the population was only about 7,000
* the population peaked in about 1550
* When European sailors first visited the Island in the 18th century they found 3,000 people left together with evidence of a once-flourishing society now living in "squalor and barbarism", at war with each other and practising cannibalism in a desperate attempt to survive.

## Social organization
* Their diet was mainly restricted to chickens and sweet potatoes, which they had brought with them, along with other less successful species.
* monotonous diet but that permitted to put time elsewhere
* the Easter Islanders engaged in elaborate rituals and monument construction

## The statues
* the statues were carved in a quarry using only obsidian tools, which took up immense amounts of peasant labour
* The most challenging task was to transport the statues, weighing several tons, across the island and then erect them on top of the ahu
* Moving the statues several miles from quarry to ahus was done by felling trees and using the trunks as rollers.

## Conflicts
* competition between the clans for making statues, and thus felling of trees
* As a result, the population started to collapse through massive environmental degradation brought on by deforestation of the whole island.

## Parallel with human history
* Like Easter Island the earth has only limited resources to support human society and all its demands. 
* Like the islanders, the human population has no practical means for escape.
* For the last two million years humans have succeeded in obtaining more food and extracting more resources on which to sustain increasing numbers of people and increasingly complex and technologically advanced societies. 
* But have they been any more successful than the islanders in finding a way of life that does not fatally deplete the resources that are available to them and irreversibly damage their life support system?
