# The Great Divergence

* "great divergence": a term coined by Kenneth Pomeranz to denote important changes between China and Western Europe from 1800 on
* compared to the period 1500-1820, the annual average growth rate of per capita GDP in Asia (excluding Japan) during the period of 1820-1870 is decreasing both absolutely and relative to Western Europe

## Eurasian ends (Western Europe and East Asia) have some elements in common:
* early discoveries (gunpowder, maths in 1700-1750)
* manufactures (ceramics)
* population centres
* financial capacity (they can raise money for large investments)
* ecological constraints (Malthusian trap)

## Eurasian ends differ
* West Europe has more material resources (superior trading networks, New World)
* West Europe has more technologies (e.g. fossil fuel)

## Discovery: Steam Engines
* Boulton has been working on steam engines, sponsored by private enterprises
* useful: 
  * to pump water out of coal mines
  * to mess with cotton to produce cotton yarn (by pulling apart cotton fibers)
* India dominated the world's textile market
* in England, they were producing wool textiles (from sheep) and wanted to protect that industry
* protectionist legislation in England to keep out the textiles imports from India
* this in turn created incentives to build steam engines

## Discovery: electricity
* Alessandra Volta worked on that
* contribution by Gauss (who haas done significant contributions in 6-7 fields)
* Michael Faraday worked on that
* as always, it's a layering of understandings

## Discovery: evolution
* Charles Darwin (5 years of scientific observations aboard the HMS Beagle)
* applying geology concepts (1840s) to biology, which led to the theory on natural selection
* his motivation: scientific interest

## Conclusions about Discoveries
* those discoveries are taking place in Western Europe
* sponsored by royal institutions, universities
* the 'discoveries' are the consequence of cumulative knowledge, collectively shared, moving forward
* scientific community enabled by common medium of exchange of information (in the form of books, presentations of scientific papers)
* an important  motivation is the reward from the community peers

## The transport revolution
* railroads
* steamships

## Communication revolution
* telegraph (widespread use in the mid-1800s)
* telephone toward the end of 1800s

## Market revolution
* shifts in India:
  * India buys cheap finished textiles products from England (instead of producing them)
  * India will produce raw materials like cotton
* India is a producer of wheat, to be distributed inland through railroads
* vast expenses provided by governments, supplemented by private finance
* often through government bonds (i.e. private investors lending money to the government)
* construction of public facilities of many kinds is a feature of the 1800s
* standardized fashions

## Cultural change
* missionary zeal (spreading education, science, religion)
* e.g. London Missionary Society (important figure: David Livingston)
* Charles Dickens writes about that era, e.g. with his novel "David Copperfield": story of a young lad who rises from difficult circumstances in an environment of people struggling to be part of a new middle-class

## 1800s
* Queen Victoria reigns from 1837 to 1901
* she stood for solid middle class values, stability order, family
* a new class of factory workers arise during the mid-1800s
* huge debates on slavery
* more than 2/3 of the cotton for England's textiles industry is coming from the south of USA
* subsistence farmers are leaving their land finding better opportunities elsewhere
* mainly coming out of Europe (Britain and Ireland in the early 1800s, then from Germany during the mid 1800s
* Australia sees a massive increase of population from the 1830 onwards, aided by railroads

## Traditional role of government
* traditional European world: 
  * king (and his soldiers) on top
  * nobles and other aristocrats, also part of government
  * everyone else
* traditional Islamic world:
  * ruler (successful warrior, held in power by his solders) - military elite
  * learned religious elite (religious, they don't consider them part of the govt, but they are nevertheless in charge of the administration of justice)
  * everyone else

## Islam
* divided in two since the early days of Islam: Sunni and Shi'a
* new ideas within Sunni Islam:
  * Sufism (older roots, strong in the 1800s, formed around joy and exaltation in the practice of Islam, involving dancing and veneration) reaches Dutch Indies and West Africa
  * Wahhabism (fundamentalists, strong in the Arabian Peninsula in the 1700s and 1800s, pushing the Ottoman Empire out of Arabia)
* mainly political form of Islam: Ottoman Empire (under a dynasty)

## Egypt
* wealthiest single part of the Ottoman Empire
* Egypt actually revives under Muhammad Ali (1830s-1840s), ruthless leader
  * develops strong military, adopting European techniques
  * commerce based on Egyptian cotton, exporting to England and elsewhere
  * controls both sides of the Red Sea

## Ottoman Empire
* fight between between Egypt and the Ottoman Empire
  * the British and French intervene to protect the Ottoman Empire against the Egyptian forces because they don't want Russia to expand to the Mediterranean 
  * they see the Ottoman empire as a bulwark against the expansion of a European rival: Russian Empire
* Suez Canal built by the Egyptians (aided by the British and the French)
* Ottoman Empire goes through a series of reforms (Tanzimat) in the 1850s, 1860s 
* liberal reforms: changing, parliament created in 1870s, extended civil rights

## Southwest Asia
* Safavid dynasty collapses in the 1770s and it's replaced by the Qajars
* the Qajars maintains its integrity by balancing the adjacent powers

## Africa (1830 - 1870)
* in the hands of traditional rulers
* many partnerships in slave trade
* Omanis from the Arabian peninsula along with the Portuguese moving hundreds of thousands of African into the Muslim world
* Africa remains under the rule of traditional kingdoms and princes
* it's deadly for Europeans to penetrate the African interior, mainly because they can't withstand the diseases
* 1860s-1870s: steamships are going up rivers and chemistry invents new pharmaceuticals

## Breaking open China and Japan
* China and Japan managed to keep the Europeans at bay for generations
* but they were broken open in the 1840s-1850s

## Increase of control
1. Mediterranean World
2. Atlantic world
3. Indian Ocean world (Africa, India, South East Asia)
4. Pacific Ocean (1840: turning point in which the American think about Pacific America, gold is discovered near San Francisco)

## Reaching the Pacific Ocean
* Sandwich Islands
  * now known as Hawai
  * local Polynesians rulers
* key British trade post: Singapore
* 2 routes to get to the Pacific Ocean from Europe and the Indian Ocean:
  * strait of Malacca
  * Sunda straits
* importance presence of the Dutch on South Asian islands
* Spanish in the Philippines

## Opium War with China (1841-1842)
* it is an outgrowth of the market revolution
* tobacco originates as a plant that can be grown in colonial North America
* tobacco was introduced to China in the 1600s
* the practice of smoking tobacco mixed with opium was widespread in China by early 1700s
* Patna, India, is an historical centre of medicinal opium production
* British wanted tea (since the best tea came from China)
* Chinese wanted silver (but the British were running out of silver)
* so British illicitly imported opium to South China from India from late 1700s
* China thought that opium was a bad habit
* British leveraged their power at sea 
* series of raids into the Chinese ports from British steamships (e.g. HMS Nemesis, aptly named for the Chinese)
* the goal is to punish the Chinese and break open the different points of entry (e.g. Shanghai, Fuzhou, Hong Kong, ports along the Yangtze River valley like Nanjing, Hankou)
* in 1860, treaty ports are also established in the "Huang He" or Yellow River Valley (north east China)
* extra territoriality: British (not Chinese) laws in the treaty ports
* at first, the great Qing Empire regarded the foreigners as a nuisance and Chinese concessions were pretty modest
* but by the 1860s, it's perceived as a much serious matter
* 1862: a British and French expedition marched all the way to Peking and burned the entire summer Palace (!)

## Japan
* they arrived in American ships, led by Commander Matthew Perry in 1853
* so far, Japanese tried to isolate the foreigners to one single trading port in Southern Japan: Nagasaki
* but Commodore Perry steamed his ships right into Tokyo Bay, at the very heart of Japanese Imperial domains
* the Japanese decided not to fight, and study with the Westerners the implications for their national future
