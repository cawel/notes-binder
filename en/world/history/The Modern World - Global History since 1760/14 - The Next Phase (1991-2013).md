# The Next Phase (1991-2013)

## Washington Consensus
* the term Washington Consensus was coined in 1989 by the economist John Williamson to describe a set of ten relatively specific economic policy prescriptions that he considered constituted the "standard" reform package promoted for crisis-wracked developing countries by Washington, D.C.-based institutions such as the International Monetary Fund (IMF), World Bank, and the US Treasury Department
* The prescriptions encompassed policies in such areas as macroeconomic stabilization, economic opening with respect to both trade and investment, and the expansion of market forces within the domestic economy.
* Subsequently to Williamson's minting of the phrase, and despite his emphatic opposition, the term Washington Consensus has come to be used fairly widely in a second, broader sense, to refer to a more general orientation towards a strongly market-based approach (sometimes described, typically pejoratively, as market fundamentalism or neoliberalism). 

## FDR's vision
* int'l cooperation among the great powers
* 4 policemen against rogue states: US, Soviet Union, Britain, China
* open trade

## Important evidence that the Cold War is over
* 1990: treaty signed in Moscow: final settlement for Germany (there has never been a treaty with Germany after WWII)
* 1990: CFE treaty (on conventional armed forces) signed in Paris; the most ambitious arms-control treaty ever negotiated
* 1990: Charter of Paris (agreement on the political and economic principles for countries in Europe, between them and in them, signed in Paris

## Evolution of the Russian Empire
* the Russian Empire was organized as a multi-national empire
* the Soviet Union replaced the Russian Empire (roughly the same covered territory)
* Soviet Union was organized on ideological principles (communism)
* as communism disappears, national principles took the place of the ideological principles
* the Russian Federation shrunk quite a bit when you compare it with the old Russian Empire

## Equalizers for the 'great convergence'
* access to finance
* access to raw materials
* access to education
* opportunities for women (but still a problem in the Muslim world and in India)
* manufacturing capability
* markets
* political enablers:
  * relative stability and openness of regional hubs (Japan, China, Europe, North America, Brazil)
  * free movement of money
  * disappearance of interstate wars
  * safe seas
  * open trading system

## Notes on public education
* public schools were created in the US on a large scale (only) around 1830-1840s
* public education does not become universal (even in England) toward the end of the 1800s

## Urbanization
* Britain was the first country to reach the 60% threshold
* US would only reach that threshold in the 1870s
* the world as a whole will reach that threshold in 2030

## Democratic Republic Congo
* colonial legacy (King Leopold)
* cold war legacy
* predatory legacy (under Mobutu)
* genocides in the Great Lakes region

## Muslim World
* West:
  * the nation has an ethno-linguistic identity, a civic definition of community
  * the rule of law is secular, outside of religious beliefs
* Muslim world:
  * the community is religious
  * deeply religions, which makes it hard to accommodate other kinds of legal preferences
* Sunni: access to the Koran is granted to anyone who can read, no pope of Islam
* Shia: structured hierarchical clergy
* in both cases, the clergy are guides, but also judges
* Islam is also a source of law
* the ruler is the surface of a traditional society

## Muslim nation-state
* Jamal Al-Din Afghani in the 1800s
  * argued that islam and European Liberalism were compatible
  * said that Islam was opposed to imperialism, to foreign interventions in their countries
  * wanted to appeal to the Khalif of the Ottoman Empire to represent all of Islam and combat European imperialism
* some other said it needed to push back and being intolerant to some foreign influences
* modern initiatives:
  * secular and nationalist state, e.g. Mustafa Kemal (Attaturk), founder of Turkey, e.g. Rezā Shāh who laid the foundation of a modern Iranian state
  * secular pan-Arab socialist answer taking shape in Egypt, Syria and Iraq
  * in the late 1950s, Nasser tried to create a United Arab Republic, that would be based in both Egypt and Syria and Yemen
 
## Iranian Revoluion (1979)
* revolution against someone who was allied to the USA
* represented a rejection of the secular nation state, of the top down modernizers
* Shiite: hierarchy of clerics, with Ayatollahs at the top
* they were asserting that they were the center of dynamic Islam
* Riyad and Theran had become rivals as to what would be the center of the revolutions of the 1980s-1990s
* Saudi Arabia invested massively to spread its fundamentalist view, including in Pakistan
* Sudan consciously adopts an Islamic govt in the 1990s and gives shelter to Alquaida
* in 1996, Ossama Bin Laden left Sudan to go to Afghanistan
* Saudi Arabia felt compelled to support their Muslim brothers in Bosnia during the Balkans war
* Alquaida is aginst the govt of Saudi Arabia

## Revolution in Afhanistan
* revolution against someone who was allied to the Soviet Union
* Soviet found itself to invade Afghanistan in 1979

## Iraq
* the American invasion took the lid off
* it created a revolution and a civil war
* the Shia majority wanted to take control of the state

## Crisis of 2008
* because money can freely move from a country to another, the danger of financial crises goes up, as it has been the pattern of the last decade
* global imbalances:
  * current account deficits (from e.g. the US) faced huge surpluses (Japan, China) in 2005-2006
  * China and others thus have hundreds of billions of dollars in their bank accounts, and wanted to use it
  * that created a demand for dollar-valued assets
  * which led to asset inflation and asset invention
* the spiking asset price inflation was not controlled by central banks because:
  * Central bankers actually thought asset inflation might be a good thing
  * Central bankers were more attuned to controlling *consumer* price inflation rather than asset price inflation

## National budgets
* in the 1950s:
  * advanced countries spent 60-70% of it on defense
  * 30-40% on social welfare
* the proportion is reversed today. reasons:
  * debts have been nationalized
  * population is aging

## The global and the local
* This course argues that the "modern" world cannot be fully understood without unpacking and understanding both global and local circumstances and the interplay between them
* examples:
  * American slavery
    * the South produces cotton desired by the entire world once it has been converted to textiles in England's mills
    * so the slave economy of the South is revitalised by British industry and the creation of a world economy of textiles
    * otherwise slavery would have been withering, just like the British empire abolished slavery in the West Indies in the 1830s because the sugar plantations were no longer profitable
  * American civil war
    * the issue for secession in 1860 is not whether to eliminate slavery, but whether slavery can expand
    * it was the north's decision to limit the further expansion of slavery that so offended the southern states and made them determined to secede from the union
    * the south thought they could win because the world needed their cotton
    * in turn, the American civil war is an outside force interacting with arguments in Europe about Liberalism
  * Taiping Rebellion (led by Hong Xiuquan)
    * Hong Xiuquan mutated Christian ideas to challenge the Ching authority
    * he thought that would be working because of the vulnerability revealed by foreign influences and their gunboats
  * the "Great Depression" and the "Great Recession"

  When UN is created, the US insisted in 1943 to have a seat for China (
  Japan: adapted 

## modern habits of thought
* mastery of natural limits
* equality and liberty
* creative destruction (fertility of change)

## Outline of history

### Phase 1: a phase of construction (1760-1870)
* playing out of the commercial and military revolutions
* rise of democratic and industrial nation-states
* zenith of liberalism (along some traditional institutions, hence we often have "constitutional monarchy")
* global networks (Suez canal, telegraph wires, steamship lines)
* conflicts:
  * American civil war
  * Taiping Rebellion
  * Indian mutiny

### Transition (1870-1880s)
* global capitalism takes form
* corporations
* global financial system (gold standard)
* modern industrial nation-states turn into imperial nation-states

### Phase 2: the great acceleration (1890s-1990s)
* acceleration
* the "great acceleration", as Lenin called the 25 years from 1890-1914
* how to organize and cope with those modern industrial societies
* a few times on the brink to destroy the planet (morally and geopolitically)

### Transition (1990s-2010s)
* great convergence

### Phase 3 (2010s-?)
* different issues

## Differences between now and the 1880s
* now in a global rights revolution (started in the 1960s-1970s)
* globalized communities, often virtual 
* hierarchies less international (there was a hierarchy for states), more transnational (divisions across societies)
* diffusion of power, not just diffusion of authority (was industrial back then, now: states, firms, gangs)
* more interdependence, more webs (internet governance)

## The erosion of "foreign" policy (e.g. G7 stability meetings to make up rules for central banks)
* global capitalism
* energy and natural resources (water scarcity, desalination of water in Saudi Arabia)
* ultra-hazardous technologies (atom bomb)
* transnational crime
* bottom billion
