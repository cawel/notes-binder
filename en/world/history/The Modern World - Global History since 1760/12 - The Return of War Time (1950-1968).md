* even if the Civil War had freed the slaves, the US south was weak
  * there were many racial issues
  * Blacks in sort of serfdom
  * oppression of the negros
  * weak economy growth
  * migrations to the North like Chicago
* a slow re-integration of the south began in the 1940s
  * The United States had stood firmly against the racially motivated tyrannies of Nazi Germany and its allies during World War II, and it was increasingly difficult to justify racial prejudice at home
  * 1954: outlawing segregation in public school, 2nd reconstruction of the South

* Korea was militarily occupied in the south as well as in the north
  * North: Kim Il Sung
  * South: Sigmun Rhee
* US removed its troops from South Korea in 1949-1950s
* US was not planning to defend South Korea in case of a North Korean/Chinese attack
* North Korea attacked the South
  * the attack on North Korea evoked feelings of 1938 and the failures to stand up to Nazi German aggression. 
  * thus, axiomatic reactions against aggression overrode previous calculations against going to war
  * the US and UN commanders allowed for their forces to become scattered and disconnected in the Korean mountains, thus allowing the Chinese forces to exploit the gaps and ambush them

  * the Soviet Union saw the conflict among the Western allies as an opportunity to be more active in the Middle East
  * decolonization efforts intensified as the British and French began to view the dismantling of their empires as inevitable
  * the British and French took more interest in an expanded European identity that would help replace their declining sense of identity as global empires
