# Revolutionary Wars

## Context
* late 1790s: the debate was centered on how to expand in the Americas
* convergence of 3 trends:
  * commercial revolution
  * military revolution
  * democractic revolution

## War of the First Coalition (1792-1797)
* first major effort of multiple European monarchies to contain Revolutionary France, the brand new French Republic
* France declared war on the Habsburg monarchy of Austria on 20 April 1792, and the Kingdom of Prussia joined the Austrian side a few weeks later

## War of the Second Coalition (1798–1802)
* second attempt by European monarchs to contain or eliminate Revolutionary France

## King Charles IV
* Spain's incompetent ruler
* Manuel Godoy (lover of the Spanish Queen, but still the favorite advisor of the king)
* Spain lost its vigor

## British failures in America
* Saint-Domingue (attacking from Jamaica, but yielding the field to former slaves)
* also trying to set foot in South America: Buenos Aires
* led to the shift of the British gaze to India

## Napoleon
* chief foreign policy advisor: Talleyrand
* he made a big effort to create a Mediterranean empire, but failed
* invasion of Egypt in 1798, but it fails by 1799
* France used to have a great empire in North America, but it lost:
  * Louisiana
  * Canada
  * Saint Domingue colony
* his plans:
  * European (and Atlantic) peace - peace with Britain means the Atlantic is a clear field
  * secret deal with Spain to return the Louisiana territory back to the French (they lost it in 1763)
  * send an expeditionary force to North America
* 1800-1802: Bonaparte makes his move
  * peace with both Austria and Britain
  * signs treaty with Spain (exchange of Louisana for some land in Tuscany in present-day Italy)
  * the United States are afraid that France would control New Orleans, the key of the subcontinent
* Bonaparte's plans fails because of the freed slaves of Saint-Domingue
  * Leclerc: leader of the French army
  * Toussaint-l'ouverture: leader of the slaves, taken capture by Napoleon
  * French are defeated
  * France sells Louisianna to the United States in 1803
  * from then on, it will allow the United States to move westward
* 1803: Napoleon swings his focus back to Europe

## Napoleonic Wars
* 1804: Napoleon scraps the French Republic and create a new French Empire
* his title changed from "First Consul" to "Emperor Napoleon 1st"
* the Napoleonic Empire was still revolutionary and implemented a social order far different than that of the Ancien Régime
* 1808: Napolean invades Spain, overthrows the Spanish monarch and replaces him with his brother Joseph
* British navy defeats the Napoloeanic navy and the Spanish navy at Trafalgar
* he lost at sea, but won on land, by the end of 1805
* 1812: invasion of Russia
* 1814: abdication in Paris
* exiled to the island of Elba, escapes, comes back to Paris, defeated at Waterloo in 1815
* creation of a large Prussian state
* creation of a large Austrian empire, superseding the more disorderly Habsburg domains
* nascent Polish state is destroyed again (going mostly to Prussia and Russia)

## Napoleon's legacy
* lawgiver (e.g. Napoleonic code)
* liberator, freeing oppressed peoples (e.g. Poland deivided up between the Prussian and Russian monarchs)
* new aristocracy based on:
  * merit
  * service (to the empire)
  * wealth

## The Holy alliance
* against republics
* against revolutions
* for Christian principles (the Russian czar Alexander I was a leader and a symbol of that alliance)
* unrest all over Europe in the 1820's
* a novel by Stendhal, "The Charter House of Parma", describes how to stay away from liberal principles (e.g. go to the mass, do not read)
* 1830's and 1840's: tension between traditional forms of rule and rising appeal of liberal beliefs

## Ethnic identities in North America
* strict ethnic hierarchy based on blood:
  * peninsulares (Spaniards from Spain to rule them): < 1%
  * creoles (people of European ancestry): 20%
  * mestizos (mixed blood with Indians) and mulattoes (mixed blood with black slaves): 40%
  * Indians/blacks (pure blood Indian or black): 40%
* emphasis on ancestry, purity of blood: "limpieza de sangre"

## 1st wave of revolts (1808-1814)
* power in the colonies is held by the Creole elite
* Cuba stays loyal to the crown because it fears a revolt from the slaves (like what happened in Saint-Domingue), and thus needs the Spanish soldiers
* common people linked themselves with the Spanish king
* New Mexico's creole elite managed to stop the revolt
* 1814: Spanish crown is restored to authority

## 2nd wave of revolutions (1820s)
* Spanish colonies are not partners to the Spanish crown, since they are under royal rule from Madrid
* now the Creole elite is revolting against the liberals in Spain
* it is a conservative reaction to the events in Spain
* France invades Spain in 1821-1822, because Spain's constitution is too liberal and threatens the Holy Alliance
* by the early 1820s the conservative Creole elite in Spanish Mexico had rebelled against a Spanish regime perceived as too liberal
* the rebels sought to create their own Mexican empire
* successful revolutions in Latin America
* colonies freed themselves from Spanish rule
* these republics turn into authoritarian states ruled by creole elites leaning toward military figures

## South American liberators
* creole elite is standing for liberal principles
* Simon Bolivar: 
  * from Caracas
  * member of the Creaole elite
  * leader in the 2nd wave of revolutions
* Jose San Martin liberates Chile and then goes north

## Monroe Doctrine
* both USA and Britain convince the Euroupean monarchs not to intervene in the New World
* famous statement in 1823 by President Monroe

## the Mexican wars
* internal conflict because of tensions between centralists and federalists
* 1821: independance from Spain
* Comanches were a horse empire (native Americans) living on present day New Mexico
* 1844: President Polk is (finally) expanding America to the west, after the Texans (American settlers) asked for it for 10 years
* the Mexican wars originate from the conflict between the centralists and federalists happening all over Latin America

## India
* key period: 1799 - 1805
* 1780s: several actors (British, Hindu Maratha confederacy, Muslim Mysore) exist on the Indian peninsula
* British strength: military
* British weaknesses:
  * East India company is still running the show (but is only interested in individual enrichment)
  * widely detested by local people
  * poverty
* Maratha strengths:
  * command large and powerful armies
  * traditional rulers
* Maratha weaknesses:
  * no access to foreign trade (British control the oceans)
 
## The Reform of British India
* it happens in the 1780s, 1790s
* governor-generals (central direction)
* rule of law (property laws, tax system)

## The British defeated the Maratha Confederacy
* in the early 1800s
* British financial strength (could buy friends, hire more soldiers)
* disunity versus British unity
* unexpected success for the British
* Governor-general of India was Richard Wellesley 
* Richard's brother = Arthur Wellesley = led several important battles = Duke of Wellington

## Consequences of the British victory
* upending Muslim tradition (Mughal empire is no more)
* upending Hindu tradition (Maratha Confederacy is no more)
* armies based on Indian soldiers, paid by a combination by Indian and British money
* the British tried to fusion the 2 cultures
* bringing better public institutions, public ideals
* but the British ideals are at odds with the way they treat the majority of the people they rule

## In Europe: comforting tradition in the spirit of the Holy Alliance
* yearning for peace after decades of war
* increased emphasis on reassuring traditional rituals and ceremonies (Catholic Christianity, Protestant Christianity, mystical strains)
* nationalism (folklore, history, Romanticism (e.g. Beethoven), Sir Walter Scott's historical novel called 'Ivanhoe')

## The rise of the Engineers
* more iron, less wood
* economic liberalism (free thinking, willing to experiment, try new things, less government)
* Britain outlaws slavery in all its domains in the 1830s
* political liberalism, free thinking, willingness to reform, e.g.
  * Jeremy Bentham 
    * British practical philosopher and social reformer 
    * He is regarded as the founder of modern utilitarianism: what would accomplish the greatest good for the greatest number
  * Benjamin Constant, trying to find a centrist consensus between Royalist reaction and revolutionary zeal

## The modern encirclement
* modern innovations, pressures from reformers, encircling the traditional world (established church, royal families)
* modern ideals are encircling the classical traditions of Islam and East Asia
* classical traditions: you prove yourself by showing that you master Qur'an, Arabic alphabet, literature, poetry
* the Pax Britannica: commerce dominated by Europeans, sheltered by the British
  * the oceans are peaceful
  * commerce brings goods and ideas
