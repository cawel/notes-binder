# Crackup (1914-1917)

## War sides
* central powers: Germany and Austro-Hungarian empire
* entente: France and Russia
* it is only once the war began that Great Britain joined France and Russia in their alliance, which turned into an alliance

## Triple Alliance (1882)
* The Triple Alliance was the military alliance between Germany, Austria–Hungary, and Italy
* as opposing the Triple Entente which consisted of an alliance between Britain, France and Russia
* lasted from 1882 until the start of World War I in 1914.
* Italy
  * When Austria–Hungary found themselves at war in August 1914 with the rival Triple Entente (Britain, France, and the latter's ally, Russia), Italy pledged to support the Central Powers: Germany, Austria-Hungary, and later the Ottoman Empire (Turkey). 
  * However, because Germany and Austria–Hungary had taken the offensive while the Triple Alliance was supposed to have been a defensive alliance, Italy did not enter into the war. Later on, Italy entered the conflict on the side of the Entente against Austria–Hungary in May 1915 and Germany in August 1916

## Why most expected peace?
* Europe was peaceful
* peace is profitable (in the interest of business)
* Germany controlled strategic initiative (time, place, manner of engagement)

## Germany == Germany Empire
* consists of different states (each having their own government):
  * Prussia
  * Kingdom of Wurttemberg
  * Saxony (capital in Dresden)
* joining together in the imperial army

## Germany's kaiser 
* head of the Germany Empire (i.e. army, navy, foreign affairs)
* king of Prussia
* Reichstag = empire's parliament 
* nobility is a tiny minority

## Wilhelm the Second
* kaiser in 1914
* grandson of Queen Victoria
* German election of 1912 led to very fragmented results
* the majority of the Reichstag was a combination of Marxists and Liberals

## Theobald of Bethmann Hollweg
* appointed by the kaiser
* the one who is really running the government
* serves at the whim of his crown master

## The Balkans 
* are anti-imperialist
* against Austro-Hungarian Empire
* against Ottoman Empire

## December 1912: the 'War Council'
* meeting between German Empire and the Austro-Hungarian Empire
* preventive war
* Austria-Hungarian alliance
* war plans (build up of the Germany army, German commitment to fight even if the conflict is in the Balkans)

## Reasons why the neighboring empires cared about the conflicts in the Balkans:
* Those empires felt ‘racial’ kinship with some of the inhabitants and prejudice against others, inclining them to help one side or the other.
* Some of those empires feared that the violent nationalisms of the Balkan nations could threaten the cohesion of their imperial domains.
* The Ottoman Empire remained resentful about having lost territory to newly formed Balkan nations and sought to reacquire some of it.

## The Ignition
* 1908: Bosnia is annexed by the Austro-Hungarian Empire
* many Serbians in Sarajevo (capital of Bosnia)
* Serbians supported by their Slav-kindred in the Russian Empire
* June 1914: crown prince of Austro-Hungarian Empire, archduke Franz Ferdinand, pays a state visit to Sarejevo
* Bosnian-Serbs terrorists, aided by a chief in the Serb intelligence, kills the archduke
* it was state-sponsored terrorism

## Sequence of events
* The assassination of Franz Ferdinand by state-sponsored Serbian terrorists led to a harsh Austro-Hungarian ultimatum to Serbia, which eventually led to an Austro-Hungarian declaration of war against Serbia
* Russia, supporting Serbia, responded to the Austro-Hungarian declaration of war on Serbia by declaring war on Austria-Hungary
* In response to the Russian declaration of war on Austria-Hungary, Germany, an ally of Austria-Hungary, declared war on Russia
* Because of the alliance between France and Russia, Germany launched a long-planned invasion of France in response to the Russian declaration of war on Austria-Hungary
* the main German response to a Balkan crisis is to attack France

## Helmuth von Moltke
* head of the Germany army
* his vision: it is Germany's moment in world history, a way to take over the leadership of mankind, toward higher ideals

## Lots of failures
* end of 1914: Japan (allied of the British by treaty) uses this as an opportunity to occupy German territory on the Chinese mainland (Shandong peninsula), German-held islands
* end of 1914: Ottoman Empire joins with Germany, Austria and Bulgaria, to form a united front
* Ottoman Empire declared a holy war - a jihad - against the British and French
* war extends to a battle for colonies
* 1915: poison gas, submarines
* 1916: Germany's strategy is to have a war of attrition against the French at Verdun, submarine warfare
* Verdun exemplifies the "war of attrition," costing both sides over 300,000 dead, and over 750,000 wounded, with little change to the front line.
* attribution runs both ways
* the US tells the Germans that if they sink US ships, the US will join the battle along side the British
* Western Front (North East of France) by late 1916: The offensives of both sides had come to bloody ruin without either the Entente or Central Powers gaining any decisive advantage
* war plans (on both sides) failed in the 2nd half of 1916, with massive loss of resources (human and others)

## The USA
* Wilson's America was neutral
* US = supplier mainly to the British and French
* good time for American agriculture

### Woodrow Wilson
* scornful to both sides' aims
* wanted America to stay out of the war
* if war continued, America was likely to be drawn to it
* idealistic but practical too
* Wilson's leverage on both sides:
  * he was viewed as neutral
  * if US in war, bad for German side
  * US lent money to UK so that they could buy means from US
* Germany is anxious to end the war lest the military takes control of the country
* Britain is led by Herbert Henry Asquith

## Peace window passes
* USA: caught in the election cycle, peace move not until December 1916 (which is too late)
* Germany's domestic politics: military will have the upper hand
* Britain's domestic politics: Lloyd George's policies (pro-war) are having the upper hand ("knockout blow")
* new leaders in 1917:
  * Britain: Lloyd George
  * France: Clemenceau "the tiger"
  * Germany: Ludendorff, effectively the military ruler of Germany
  * USA: call for "a peace without victory"
* the primary goal of German unrestricted submarine warfare in 1917: it was intended to cut off the supplies coming from the United States and elsewhere, without which the Entente could not continue to prosecute the war and would be forced to sue for peace
* In Russia, the Russian people rise up and overthrew the monarchy
* USA joins in the European conflict in April 1917
