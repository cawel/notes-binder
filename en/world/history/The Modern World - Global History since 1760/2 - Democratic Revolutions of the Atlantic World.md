# Democratic Revolutions of the Atlantic World

## The Diffusion of Authority
* knowledge
* force
* money

## Knowledge in the 1700s
* literacy and printed matter
* understanding of God's laws
* university and scientific methods

## Evolution of ideas
* wealth is progressively democratized, disseminating in the middle-class
* example in the 1700s: Denis Diderot wrote an encyclopedia
* Jean-Jacques Rousseau: "authority comes from the individual"
* "social contract" from Jean-Jacques Rousseau
* revolutionary insight: the individual in his natural state is the source of sovereign power

## The constituted order
* the king
* intermediaries (parliament, city councils)
* aristocracy (nobles, priests, few wealthy people)

## Privileges
* there has been an accumulation of privileges, liberties, customary protections
* from different groups:
 * merchants
 * craftsmen (organized in guilds)
 * nobles 

## Despotism or tyranny
* the constituted order can be contrasted with a despotic order
* despotic order: system in which there is a ruler (e.g. a king) with *unprotected* subjects

## Clash between the king and the aristocracy in the 1700s
* king against parliament (nobility)
* the king represented general welfare, everyone
* in America and in France, what begins as an upper-class movement resentful of royal assertion (with the King often the one claiming to act on behalf of the whole nation) becomes, when mobilized into action, something else. 
* the ideas have a power and logic that keeps spreading in a society where authority of all kinds has been growing more diffuse 
  * An Estates General turns into a National Constituent Assembly — the Third Estate effectively seceding from the other two and asserting itself. 
  * A National Constituent Assembly turns into a National Convention. And so on.

## Democratic revolutions
* revolutions happening in the "Atlantic world"
* 2 important historians:
  * Godechot
  * R. R. Palmer (focus on a revolution against aristocracy, open up the membership of constituted bodies)

## Nature of the democratic revolution
* they were for a kind of equality, or at least a discomfort with older forms of social stratification and formal ranks
* they were against the possession of government, or any public power, by any established, privileged, closed, or self-recruiting groups of men
* focusing on privileges
* relevant question then: who are the citizens?

## France in 1770- 1774
* fight about money
* the king needs more money to build the fiscal-military state
* after the 7-year war with Britain
* Louis XV vs parlements (nobility)
* nobles do not want to pay more money in taxes "you have to respect our privileges"
* 1774: Louis XV dies
* Louis XVI = "the Restorer of French Liberty" 
* 1774: Louis XVI restores the nobles' privileges
* nobles have thus won this fight

## State of Affairs in America after 1763
* peace of Paris in 1763
* thinly populated 13 colonies
* they are facing the Atlantic:
  * send their goods, receive their goods
* they felt part of Greater Britain
* rights of Englishmen
* they feel like they have customary rights and traditions

## Boston Tea Party
* in 1770, Boston people dressed as Indians, throwing tea out in the sea
  * arguments: East India Company monopoly (forced to buy tea from that company)
  * British monopoly on trade
* objection to "tyranny": no check on royal power
* revolution started out in 1775

## American Revolution
* New England's perspective:
  * common causes (i.e. alliance of 13 colonies to overthrow the British rule)
  * they had created a body: 'continental Congress'
  * 1776: these colonies will call for independence
  * most important city in the colony: New York
* British perspective:
  * British advantage: Navy
  * British disadvantage: hard to occupy large land areas
* 1777: battle of Saratoga, and France joins the war against the British 
* battle of Yorktown

## Settlement
* tremendous tensions between colonies (some want war, some want peace)
* the Americans got extremely advantageous peace terms in 1782, and another signed in Paris in 1783
* 1782: a new British government wanted a reconciliation, so they offered a generous deal
* British still controlled New York and some harbours on the coast
* the British gave territories up to the Mississippi River

## Spanish Empire
* occupies all territories West of the 13 colonies
* since land transportation was impossible, they needed rivers (down the Ohio River toward the Gulf of Mexico)
* the Spanish controlled the outlet to the world (through New Orleans)
* the colonies were able to cut deals with the Spanish

## The American Constitution
* there were lots of compromises while writing the articles of the Confederation
* James Madison, principal author of the constitution, and was deeply unhappy (because of compromises)
* he wanted a compound republic (a republic of republics)
* example of compromise: since some colonies were for slavery and some against, a salve is 3/5 of a person in terms of representation
* they created separated powers: pluralism by design
* powers: 
  * one body of the congress to represent the upper classes
  * one body of the congress directly elected (by men of property)
  * president
* it was designed so that no one power could be dominant
* they deliberately decided that they don't want to speak with one voice, so that this federation could never turn into one of those hated tyrannies

## The word "liberty"
* versus dogma (liberty as free thinking)
* versus tyranny (not subject to arbitrary unchecked power, rule of law, questioning about the roles of those intermediaries institutions)
* in uneasy relation to democracy (right to vote, broad representation)

## The term "common sense"
* famous book titled "Common sense" by Tom Paine in 1776
* wisdom of experience (scientific method: conducting experiments to develop empirical data, evidence of experience)
* wisdom of the many
* in uneasy relation to philosophy, indeed, common sense might fly in the face of:
  * science
  * wisdom of people who have just given more thought to the subject
  * wisdom of people who have a greater stake of what's get to be decided

## French Revolution
* Louis XVI convened the "estates general"
* 3 estates:
  * 1st: clergy
  * 2nd: nobles
  * 3rd: others
* Abbe Sieyes writes a pamphlet "What is the Third Estate"
* arguments like these fire the passion of both the emerging new classes of French authority (lawyers, business men) and the streets of Paris
* they overthrow the "estates general"
* a new assembly needs to be created

## The Constitutional Monarchy
* Declaration of the Rights of Man and Citizen (with the help of Thomas Jefferson, author of the declaration of Independence, and ambassador of the new American Republic in Paris)
  * article 1: men are born and remain free and equal in rights. Social distinctions can be based only on public utility
  * article 2: the aim of every political association is the preservation of the natural rights of man (liberty, security, resistance to oppression)
  * article 3: the source of all sovereignty resides essentially in the nation
* the notion of the "Nation"
* important question: who were the citizens?
* only 1/5 of France would be considered citizens
* Mirabeau: powerful spokesman for this new kind of citizen
* Marquis de Lafayette
  * volunteered on George Washington's side.
  * commander of France's new national army

## Failure of the Constitutional Monarchy
* Overthrown in August 10 1792
* reasons:
  * financial decision: replaced hard money with paper money, which created inflation, made it harder to people to buy food, contributed to social unrest
  * religion: they nationalized the Catholic Church. All the priests had to become state officials
  * the King's lack of leadership: Louis XVI was weak, ambivalent toward the revolution
    * nobles are fleeing France, the king's own brother fled France (and led people trying to overthrow the French revolutionary government)
  * France is at war in 1792 (at home and abroad)
* the mob exerts its authority in Paris in August 1792
* common people: they think of themselves as the "sans-culottes" (knee breeches)
* Louis XVI is executed in January 1793

## The 1st French Republic
* national convention
* they went to the prison and butchered 1400 people
* terror is needed in order to sustain the new state
* monism (governing philosophy with an emphasis on unity, "once voice", a minimum of dissent) vs pluralism (many voices, separation of government)
* the Committee of Public Safety (decides on who are the enemies of the revolution)

## Reign of Terror
* 1793 - 1794
* Maximilian Robespierre: primary leader of the Committee of Public Safety
* a nation in arms
* counter-revolutionary revolt (as well as some other places in France) 
* in Vendée, the French revolutionary republic sends armies with orders to destroy towns
* since 1791, slave revolt in Saint-Domingue (which culminates to the birth of Haiti in 1804)
* Robespierre overthrown in 1794
* 2 views of Robespierre:
  * a man of necessity (to preserve the gains of the revolution)
  * a symbol of tyranny

## The Bourgeois Republic
* 1794- 1799
* Napoleon Bonaparte
  * will invade Egypt
  * will replace the republic with a consulate
* First Consul (saviour of the republic), overthrowing the directory that had run the Republic to that point
* firm leadership to the Republic, leading a new kind of aristocracy
* aristocracy of merit
* merit defined as service to the republic and to its consul

## The world looks at France in the 1700s
* France is the most important country
* people are choosing sides
* in America, all of domestic politics of the 1790s is dominated by your stance on the French revolution
* if you supported the French revolution, you are a Republican (led by Thomas Jefferson)
* if you opposed the revolution, you are a Federalist, calling the Republicans the 'Jacobins' or 'democrats'
* Federalists accused Republicans of being "democrats" (at that time a term of abuse, a synonym for mob rule). Republicans accused Federalists of being "monarchists," trying to restore aristocratic tyranny with its fiscal-military state.
the power of counterrevolution
* world impact:
  * India who were against the British, the Sultan of Mysore, who is fighting against them, is joining the Jacobin Club and asks the French for advice
  * In Spanish America (and in Spain), people are divided by their attitudes towards the Catholic Church and its aristocracy

## The state of affairs in the 1790s
* French Republic has survived, led by a strong first Consul
* the French Republic is the strongest military power in Europe
* the French revolutionary cause has become a global cause, convulsing the Atlantic world
* all those revolutions (commercial, military, democratic) creates a momentum as Europeans are now infused with the confidence that the fight they are in will define the political future
