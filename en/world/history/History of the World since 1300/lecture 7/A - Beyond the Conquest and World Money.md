# Beyond the Conquest and World Money

## Relationship between wealth and power
* erosion of secular central authority in the Mughal Empire
* there was a compound regime (that tied local chieftains and kingdoms to central Mughal authority)
* arrival of European traders and European money would change the balance of power
* they undermined the link between local authorities and central Mughal authority
* paradox: more wealth gives rise to an intensification of the struggle for power, and the power the struggle for power would motivate the drive for new sources of wealth
* fuelled the instability of the 17th century
* Bengal was the richest province of the Mughal Empire, and was engulfed into the conflict
* the Peacock Throne was raided by a Turkic tribe in 1739 and brought in Persia

## 30 years' war
* Western European powers buried the hatchet with the 1648 treaty
* peace in Western Europe translated into war abroad
* series of world wars into the 1750s and would not really end until the end of the Cold War

## Interconnectedness and interdependence
* new phenomenon in world history: world money
* European ships connected the trade networks across the Atlantic, the Indian Ocean and the Pacific after the 1570s
* European were able to enter Asian markets and provided Asians with useful commodities
* commodities: precious metals coming from America mines or wealth produced by African labor: silk, spices, porcelains
* Europeans were delivering the old preciosities of the 1300s

## Consequences of the 30 years' war
* the Dutch won their independence from Spain
* Spain, France and England were left in great debt
* the denominational and basic political boundaries of Western Europe were established
