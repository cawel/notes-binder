# Conclusions

## Rival entrance
* local traders would play one off against the other
* pepper prices were initially very high
* Arab merchants figured out how to flood the market with pepper
* it even reopened trade through the Red Sea in Alexandria
* pepper prices dropped, profits fell
* cost of sustaining the empires (colonies) in Indian Ocean and East Asia rose
* wars between the Europeans themselves (cost to build fleets)
* the benefits of empires declined
* Arab merchant men could manipulate Europeans who had become vulnerable

## One model: European colonies
* the Dutch and Portuguese empires were based on an alliance between merchants and the state
* the merchants would buy license from the state 
* merchants generated mercantile rents
* the state would invest in navies to protect merchants
* arrangements of sovereignty abroad w/o controlling territory
* control the trade systems from the periphery of the Asia dynasties
* they did not have the military dynasties of the larger polities of East Asia
* looked rather like the trading posts off the coast of Africa
* did not create powerful colonies as they were doing in America (except for the spice islands by the Dutch)

## Another model: East-Asian dynasties (China and India)
* they were agrarian dynasties and lived off taxes skimmed off agricultural producers, rather than mercantile rents produced by merchants
* controlling territory was important
* they did not rely as much on the local sultanates

## Consequences
* the Mughals would drive the Portuguese from Bengal in 1632
* Japan did the same to all missionaries who arrived in Japan in 1637
* by the late 17th century, the Europeans, at best, could control some toeholds
* in contrast to the vast colonies they were creating in territorial Americas

## Balance of power shifted within Europe
* European expansion ushered in an increasingly Euro-centered world
* it augmented a disequilibirum within Europe, hardly a stable entity
* Spain was under attack all over, abroad and in Europe
* disputes in Germany and Holland (which was part of the Spanish Empire)

## the European Reformation
* in 1520, Martin Luther published on the freedom of Christian man
* it gave rise to a century of religious wars over denominational cultures within Europe
* New World silver drawn out of Andean mines was used to fuel these religious wars
* silver funded the reformation and counter-reformation struggles
* new religious orders were created to wage this spiritual, military, economic contest
* Jesuits were funded in 1534 to defend a tradition of piety

## Disequilibirum within Europe 
* the Dutch resisted, drawing resources from their East Indian colonies
* silver from Mexico poured into coffers of Spanish mercenaries
* war in Holland became Spain's Vietnam
* each side depended on a system of predation and exploitation from the rest of the world to harness resources to wage the war at home
* globalization of European power fuelled the violence within Europe itself
* cycle of religious warfare in the 16th and 17th century
* butchery across the continent such as the St-Bartholomew's Day Massacre in France
* culminated in the 30-years war (1618 and 1648) ending with the treaty of Westphalia

## Treaty of Westphalia
* marks the rise of Holland, France and England
* decisive moment in the end of European feuding between the polities of Europe
* end of the dream that Europe might be governed by a new Roman Empire, a universal monarchy
