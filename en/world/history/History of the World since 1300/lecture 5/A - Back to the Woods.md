# Back to the Woods

* silver would flow into the capillary systems of that first globalization
* sugar would transform people's diets
* African and Indian labor would produce the staples for other people's consumption

## City of Batavia
* Dutch colony
* origin of modern day Jakarta
* Chinese, Portuguese, 
* majority of Javans, minority of Dutch
* built to oversee the creation of an American style of colony in Asia (extract stapes as commodities for other people's consumption)

## Banda Islands
* native population wiped out (just like what happened in the Caribbean's)
* Dutch imported slaves (from the rest of South East Asia) on the islands
* slaves coming from Bali, from Papua, from India
* booming Pacific slave trade to sustain that Dutch colony of Batavia

## Comparisons
* commodities of the New World: sugar, cotton, coffee
* Dutch commodities: nutmeg, cinnamon, mace (similar to nutmeg), cloves, and other commercially produced spices
* traded with the use of the Spanish doubloon, made from silver extracted from Peru

## Changes regarding the kind of society
* Arab merchants were in control of the transaction of spices produced by villagers whose surplus production could be put into the commercial networks around Afro-Eurasia
* Dutch: what used to be a luxury, preciosity, becomes a commodity
* the Dutch were producing a society very different from that early model primitive globalization (old spice trade)

## choke points of the trading system were important:
* cosmopolitan cities
* most common belief system was Islam
* most common language was Arabic
* economically highly specialized
* heavily dependent on trade

## Example: Hormuz
* south of Persian Gulf
* no access to fresh water
* all its water had to be imported

## Port of Aden
* bottom of the Red Sea
* no access to arable land
* all its food had to be imported

## Indian Ocean system
* Muslim traders had control of the supply of the important ingredients that would sustain these cities
* from Indonesia to Alexandria
* by 1500
* trading systems created powerful merchant classes
* many would ally with the political systems, e.g. Ottoman, to negotiate patterns of trade
* alliance with princes of Moghul India
* increasing wealth of the Indian Ocean system sustained state formation

## Implicit pact
* while merchants would produce rents fro their private consumption, a share of that could be turned over to emerging states in the form of revenues
* a rising state system that could thrive off the backs of this commercial system
