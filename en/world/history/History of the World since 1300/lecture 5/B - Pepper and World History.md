* akin to the role which Dona Marina in Mexico played with Cortes

## Da Gama meets King Zamorin
* 23 days to cross the Indian Ocean
* 1490's, he entered the port of Callicut
* 3 small heavy vessels, 2 masted, very high
* entered Calicut
* Calicut was a great entrepot for pepper
* very inappropriate beginnings
* all he had to offer was some hats, metal cookware, butter, some honey
* the king and his courtiers laughed at him (as trade goods, they were worthless)
* the negociations took 3 months

## Back to Lisbon
* they took 4 hostages while escaping (without paying the exit tax)
* he headed right into the monsoons
* he lost some ships
* back to Lisbon, 2 vessels survived
* cargo of spices was relatively modest, but it paid for the entire expedition and still yielded a profit

* arrival of a new source of spices
* Europeans were now able to trade directly with the Indian Ocean
* might be the reason for the demise of the Venetian economy
* the beginning, after 1500, of centuries of commercial warfare in the Indian Ocean and the China seas
