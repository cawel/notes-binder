# Early European Empires in Asia

## Pattern of aggression and war-making
* Da Gama went a 2nd time to Calicut, and massacred many people on its way, to show King Zamorin he was no wimp
* Pedro Cabral returned to Calicut 2 years after Da Gama: he bombarded the port for 2 days
* between 1510-1515, the Portuguese took Goa, Malacca, Hormuz
* those cities were targets for Portuguese penetration into the Indian Ocean system
* the combination of surprise and the power of European military technology on ships changed the rules of the game
* the Portuguese were changing the balance of the world, creating new hubs in Asia

## "Estado da India" system
* Portuguese system based in Goa 
* included Macao
* an alliance of the Portuguese government with a navy and merchant men to sustain entrepot-cities
* the Portuguese gave a passport (a "cartaz") to the merchants
* that was just state-sponsored piracy!

## Portuguese meeting with Chinese: another type of encounter
* Tom√© Pires (apothecary) was sent to China
* fascinated with drugs, spices
* goal: gather what he could find out on those Chinese lands
* plant trade
* bananas, hibiscus, bamboo, nutmeg, pepper
* Pires wanted negotiated a treaty with Chinese Emperor to wage a war against Islam
* he was forced to wait
* Pires was arrested
* their vessels were sunk by the Chinese
* 1522: Pires sentenced by the Chinese emperor, guilty of piracy and espionage

## South-Asian arm race
* as a consequence of the arrival of Europeans in the region
* China forced the Europeans to trade at the outskirts of the Chinese system
* competition for trade
* No one was to come on main land China
* local kings and princes built large standing armies
* Europeans had to reenforce their commercial plans with military power
