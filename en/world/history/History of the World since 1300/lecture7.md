# Beyond the Conquest and World Money

## Relationship between wealth and power
* established Mughal Empire regime
  * the regime tied local chieftains and kingdoms to central Mughal authority
* erosion of the secular central authority in the Mughal Empire
  * arrival of European traders and European money would change the balance of power
  * they undermined the link between local authorities and central Mughal authority
* paradox which fuelled the instability of the 17th century
  * more wealth gives rise to an intensification of the struggle for power, 
  * and the struggle for power would motivate the drive for new sources of wealth
* Bengal was the richest province of the Mughal Empire, and was engulfed into the conflict
* the Peacock Throne was raided by a Turkic tribe in 1739 and brought in Persia

## 30 years' war
* Western European powers buried the hatchet with the 1648 treaty
* peace in Western Europe translated into war abroad
* series of world wars into the 1750s which would not really end until the end of the Cold War
* Consequences of the 30 years' war:
  * the Dutch won their independence from Spain
  * Spain, France and England were left in great debt
  * the denominational and basic political boundaries of Western Europe were established

## Interconnectedness and interdependence
* new phenomenon in world history: world money
* European ships connected the trade networks across the Atlantic, the Indian Ocean and the Pacific after the 1570s
* European were able to enter Asian markets and provided Asians with useful commodities
* commodities: precious metals coming from America mines or wealth produced by African labor: silk, spices, porcelains
* Europeans were delivering the old preciosities of the 1300s

## China
* China bounced back from the Mongol conquest of the 14th century with the creation of the Ming dynasty (1368-1644)
* high demand for silver
  * major importer of silver
  * before silver was coming mainly from mines of Japan
  * later it came from the supply in the new World (Acapulco, Mexico)
  * between 1500 and 1650, 50% of all European imports would be paid for in silver

### Single Whip Method
* 1581: the empire enrolled the "Single Whip Method": a kind of harmonized land tax payable in silver
  * the result of an important fiscal tax reform
  * it was an effective tax system
* consequences
  * important factor for the consolidation of Ming state formation
  * one index of this process was the pace of urbanization
  * upper classes could now pay Chinese imports with sliver
  * Chinese were fond of Japanese lacquer wares, live turkeys as pets, Antiquities like Tibetan religious texts

### Renovation process
* New Confucianism which advocated self-improvement, moral vigour and self-cultivation through studies
* it helped update policies and practices of a powerful centralized state
* major figure behind this renovation process was Wang Yangming (1472-1529) who taught that each moral virtue was embedded within each person but needed to be cultivated
* it was a strongly individualist and egalitarian philosophy
* the basis of revitalization of Chinese society and the Ming Dynasty
* enormous influential amount of dynamism at the core of the Chinese state, and soon felt at the periphery

### Peculiarities of an agrarian state
* as with India, China was an agrarian aristocracy
* the founder of the Ming dynasty in the 14th century argued that agriculture is the foundation of the nation
* agrarian wealth was important for the underlying health of the regime
* the ability of this regime to negotiate its relationship with outer peripheries are very different from mercantile and commercial empires

### The south
* it opened up new lands for settlements in the periphery of China, placing farmers ever further on the frontiers
* market-led movement toward the south
* increased opportunities for producing staples would lure framers to these territorial peripheries in the south
* important basis for this activity was the thriving hub of Canton
* opening up ports in the Pearl River Delta (Hong Kong and Macau) would extend the process of southernization of the Chinese population
* Europeans' demand for silk rose and they would thus pump silver into the Chinese system
* between 1550 ad 1645, an average of 100 000 kg/year of silver entered the region
* phenomenal population increase from 4 million in 1400 to 12 millions 1640

### Destruction of natural ecosystem in South China
* swamps giving way to mulberry trees, rice paddies, hemp
* deployment of irrigation technologies to drain swamps of water
* result: important conversion of Southern China from being a region of biodiversity to a region dominated by crops grown for commercial purposes
* natural ecological systems gave way to agricultural ecosystems
* spell doom for many non-human macro-fauna of the region, e.g. elephants would go extinct, tigers nearly entirely extinct

### Under the Ming dynasty, China's economy boomed due to those factors
* more effective tax system
* the expansion of the agrarian frontiers southwards

## Japan in the 1600s
* primary source of silver for Chinese markets
* civil war in Japan (similar to European civil wars)
* regional warlords struggling for power
* arrival of merchants and missionaries
* homogeneity: shared Buddhist fate
* tradition of resisting threats from the outside (prevented Mughal, Portuguese and Dutch conquests)
* tokugawa shogunate (military leader) 
  * pushing out European outsiders
  * led to a more centralized, militarized state system
  * turning inward

## Russia
* silver entering from the west (Poland and Lithuania)
* Russians moving toward the East into Siberia
* high demand for pelts for top hats
* 1721: Peter the Great founded St-Petersburg

## China
* Climate changes
  * early 1600s: mini ice age
  * droughts => decline in food production => increasing famine almost everywhere on the globe
  * grain riots from China all the way to Spain
* empires trying to fill the space
  * 1640: Portugal would rebel against Spain
  * 1610-1630: Dutch and English harassed Spanish galleons to Manilla 
  * decline of New World's silver
  * shortage of liquidity led to a contraction of trade
* China's internal threat (peasant revolt)
  * compounding external threats at the borders
  * 1640: full-scale civil war in China
  * depopulation, forests moved back in, and so did the tigers
  * the Ming empire collapsed relatively quickly because they were busy defending northern borders
  * Li Zicheng overthrew the Ming Dynasty
    * 1644: led his troops in Beijing
    * 1645: driving Ming army out of Beijing

## Qing Empire (1644-1911)
* the Han majority was now ruled by the Manchu minority
* Qing Conquistador: Gao Zhong
* it had the effect of turning the Chinese people inward
* ways for the Manchus to build legitimacy/loyalty: 
  * opening new lands for Han farmers
  * dress code (straight jacket, shaved forehead)
* expansion urge meant massive armies were raised
* struggle between Russia and China
* 1691: Qing campaign to conquer Turkestan
