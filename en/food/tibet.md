# Tibet

## Intro
* Tibetan cuisine reflects local climates and customs. 
* Few crops grow at the high altitudes that characterize Tibet, although a few areas in Tibet are low enough to grow such crops as rice, oranges, bananas, and lemon.
* The most important crop is barley. Flour milled from roasted barley, called tsampa, is the staple food of Tibet.
* Balep is Tibetan bread eaten for breakfast and lunch. 
* Thukpa is mainly consumed for dinner. It consists of noodles of various shapes, vegetables, and meat in broth. 

## Cuisine comparisons
* Tibetan cuisine is traditionally served with bamboo chopsticks, in contrast to other Himalayan cuisines, which are eaten by hand. 
* Small soup bowls are also used, and rich Tibetans are fed from bowls of gold and silver.
* As well as consumed in Tibet, varieties of Tibetan dishes are consumed in Ladakh, Sikkim, Arunachal Pradesh and by the Tibetan diaspora in India, and various regions of northern Nepal, such as Mustang.
* Mustard seed is cultivated in Tibet and therefore features heavily in its cuisine.

## Tingmo
* a type of steamed bun, a heavier version of the Chinese baozi
* Relatively quick and easy to make, ting momos — usually called tingmo — are very commonly cooked in Tibetan homes. 
* Inside Tibet, they are often eaten at breakfast with rice porridge (dreythuk), while in exile, tingmo are more likely to be eaten with hot sauce along with lunch or dinner.

## A note on vegetarianism
* Despite the common misconception that Tibetans are primarily vegetarian, actually they love to eat meat, though it may not be commonly eaten in the countryside in Tibet, because it is considered expensive.
* Traditionally, this would have been yak (yak-sha), beef (lang-sha), mutton (lug-sha), and goat (ra-sha). 
* Nomads would be more likely to have yak, while farmers in central Tibet would eat more beef, mutton and goat, mostly because they had more access to these animals.
* Meat dishes are likely to be yak, goat, or mutton, often dried or cooked in a spicy stew with potatoes. 
* Yak yoghurt, butter, and cheese are frequently eaten, and well-prepared yoghurt is considered something of a prestige item.
