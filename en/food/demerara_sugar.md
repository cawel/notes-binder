# Demerara Sugar

* In the United Kingdom, a common natural brown sugar is sold as demerara sugar
* after the Demerara colony (named after the river) in Guyana (a former Dutch colony). 
* This was the original source of the sugar, although most of it is now produced in Mauritius.
* The bulk of demerara production now takes place on the island of Mauritius, but the name appears to have endured. 
* It is extracted primarily from sugar cane, rather than sugar beets, and tends to be more expensive than refined sugars as a result. 
* The minimal processing gives demerara sugar a unique flavor and texture.
* Demerara sugar is a type of unrefined sugar with a large grain and a pale to golden yellow color. 
* It is suitable for a number of cooking and baking projects, and tends to be very popular as a sweetener for tea and coffee.
* To make demerara sugar, sugar producers press sugar cane and steam the juice of the first pressing to form thick cane syrup. The cane syrup is allowed to dehydrate, leaving behind large golden brown crystals of sugar. 
* Demerara sugar is not refined, so it has a rich, creamy, molasses-like flavor which enhances baked goods. 
* The large grains also remain crunchy through cooking, which makes demerara sugar a great choice of sprinkled topping on scones and similar dishes which might otherwise have a uniform texture.

# Turbinado sugar
* in the United States, a similar sugar is called turbinado sugar, 
* after the "turbines" or centrifuges in which it is spun.
* In the United States, most turbinado sugar is produced in Hawaii and is often sold as an organic product.
