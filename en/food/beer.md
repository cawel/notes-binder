# Beers

## Intro
* All beer falls into one of these two categories - Ale or Lager.

## Beer production
### Wort
* Wort is the liquid extracted from the mashing process during the brewing of beer or whisky. Wort contains the sugars that will be fermented by the brewing yeast to produce alcohol.
* Mash ingredients, mash bill, or grain bill are those materials used in brewing from which a wort can be obtained for fermenting into alcohol.
* The first step in wort production is to make malt from dried, sprouted barley. 
* The malt is then run through a roller mill and cracked. This cracked grain is then mashed, that is, mixed with hot water and steeped, a complex and slow heating process that enables enzymes to convert the starch in the malt into sugars. 
* Lautering is the next step, which simply means the sugar-extracted grist or solids remaining in the mash are separated from the liquid wort. 
* In homebrewing, the malt-making and mashing steps can be skipped by adding malt extract to water
* The mixture is then boiled to sanitize the wort and, in the case of most beer production, to extract the flavour and aroma from hops.
* In beer making, the wort is known as "sweet wort" until the hops have been added after which it is called "hopped wort".

### Yeast
* It is the yeast that makes the difference between the ale and the lager. Ale yeasts flocculate at the top of the fermentation tank. They generally thrive at temperatures between 60 to 72 degrees Fahrenheit. Lager yeasts are more successful at lower temperatures, typically 46 to 55 degrees Fahrenheit and flocculate closer to the bottom of the fermentation tank. Lager yeasts also tend to ferment more aggressively, leaving behind less residual sweetness and flavor than ales. 
* The brewing techniques of each are as important as the yeast used. After fermentation ales are usually aged no more than a few weeks. The aging process is generally done at 40 to 55 degrees Fahrenheit. Lagers are similarly aged but at much lower temperatures, 32 to 45 degrees Fahrenheit, and for a much longer time typically months. This is called lagering and creates a cleaner, clearer beer.
* The brewing processes of the two different kinds of beer - lager, cold and efficient; and ale, warm and complex - result in very different final products. Lagers are clean, refreshing beers with typically light aroma and flavor. They are invariably served cold and can pair easily with a wide variety of food. Ales are complex, flavorful beers. Many are served closer to room temperature and contain rich aroma and flavor. 
* Saccharomyces pastorianus is a yeast used industrially for the production of lager beer, and is named after Louis Pasteur. It is a synonym of the yeast species Saccharomyces carlsbergensis, which was originally described in 1883 by Emil Christian Hansen, who was working for the Danish brewery Carlsberg
* Top cropping yeasts are so called because they form a foam at the top of the wort during fermentation. An example of a top-cropping yeast is Saccharomyces cerevisiae, sometimes called an "ale yeast"

### Lager
* a beer brewed by slow fermentation and matured under refrigeration
* Lager (German: storage) is a type of beer that is fermented and conditioned at low temperatures
* Pale lager is the most widely-consumed and commercially available style of beer in the world. 
* Bock, Pilsner, Dortmunder Export and MÃ¤rzen are all styles of lager
* There are also dark lagers, such as Dunkel and Schwarzbier. 

### Ale
* an alcoholic beverage brewed especially by rapid fermentation from an infusion of malt with the addition of hops 
* Ale is a type of beer brewed from malted barley using a warm-fermentation with a strain of brewers' yeast.
* The yeast will ferment the beer quickly, giving it a sweet, full bodied and fruity taste. 
* Most ales contain hops, which help preserve the beer and impart a bitter herbal flavour that balances the sweetness of the malt.
* varieties of ale: brown ale, pale ale, scotch ale, mild ale, burton ale, old ale, belgium ale

## Beer styles

### Pale Lager
* The brewing process for this beer developed in the mid 19th century when Gabriel Sedlmayr took pale ale brewing techniques back to the Spaten Brewery in Germany and applied it to existing lagering brewing methods. 
* This approach was picked up by other brewers, most notably Josef Groll who produced Pilsner Urquell. 
* The resulting pale coloured, lean and stable beers were very successful and gradually spread around the globe to become the most common form of beer consumed in the world today
* The main elements of the lagering method used by Sedlmayr and Groll are still used today, and depend on a slow acting yeast (Saccharomyces pastorianus) that ferments at a low temperature while being stored. Indeed, the German term 'Lager' means 'storage'.
* The resulting pale coloured, lean and stable beers were very successful and gradually spread around the globe to become the most common form of beer consumed in the world today, and includes the American beer Budweiser, the world's highest volume selling beer.

### Pale Ale
* The higher proportion of pale malts results in a lighter colour.
* The term "pale ale" was being applied around 1703 for beers made from malts dried with coke (a fuel with few impurities and a high carbon content), which resulted in a lighter colour than other beers popular at that time. 
* Different brewing practices and hop levels have resulted in a range of taste and strength within the pale ale family.

### IPA
* India Pale Ale or IPA is a style of pale ale developed in England for export to India. 
* In the early 1700s Britain had a problem. Troops and British citizens living in India as part of the colonial rule did not have access to good British ale and any attempts to ship the malt British ales to them resulted in spoilage. India Pale Ale, or IPA, was the solution. The generous amount of hops in this brew protected it from the heat and motion of the British sailing ships of the day.
* The first known use of the expression "India pale ale" is in an advertisement in the Liverpool Mercury (a newspaper) of January 30, 1835.
* India Pale Ale or IPA is a beer style within the broader category of pale ale.
* East Coast IPAs are distinguished from West Coast IPAs by a stronger malt presence which balances the intensity of the hops whereas the latter foreground the hops more, possibly because of the proximity of West Coast breweries to hop fields in the Pacific Northwest. East Coast breweries rely more on spicier European hops and specialty malts than those on the West Coast.

### APA
* American Pale Ales are generally around 5% abv with significant quantities of American hops, typically Cascade
* it is particularly the American hops that distinguish an APA from British or European pale ales.[19] The style is close to the American India Pale Ale (IPA), and boundaries blur, though IPAs are stronger and more assertively hopped

### Amber Ale
* Amber ale is a term used in Australia, France and North America for pale ales brewed with a proportion of crystal malt to produce an amber colour generally ranging from light copper to light brown.
* A small amount of crystal or other coloured malt is added to the basic pale ale base to produce a slightly darker colour, as in some Irish and British pale ales

### Crystal malt
* Crystal malts are prepared separately from pale malts. They are high-nitrogen malts that are wetted and roasted in a rotating drum before kilning. They produce strongly sweet toffee-like flavors and are sufficiently converted that they can be steeped without mashing to extract their flavor. 
* Crystal malts are available in a range of colors, with darker-colored crystal malts kilned at higher temperatures producing stronger, more caramel-like overtones. 
* Some of the sugars in crystal malts caramelize during kilning and become unfermentable; hence, addition of crystal malt will increase the final sweetness of a beer.

### Belgium Ales
* Trappist beers are brewed under direct control of the monks themselves. Of the 171 Trappist monasteries throughout the world, only seven brew beer, of which there are six in Belgium. The seventh is in the Netherlands. Abbey beer is brewed by commercial breweries in the style of a trappist beer, sometimes using the name of a monastery, often one that no longer exists or in some cases one that has licensed its name to a brewery.

### Lambic
* Lambic is a type of beer brewed traditionally in the Pajottenland region of Belgium (southwest of Brussels) and in Brussels itself at the Cantillon Brewery and museum. 
* Lambic is now mainly consumed after refermentation, resulting in derived beers such as Gueuze or Kriek lambic.
* Unlike conventional ales and lagers, which are fermented by carefully cultivated strains of brewer's yeasts, lambic beer is produced by spontaneous fermentation: it is exposed to the wild yeasts and bacteria that are said to be native to the Senne valley, in which Brussels lies. 
* It is this unusual process which gives the beer its distinctive flavour: dry, vinous, and cidery, usually with a sour aftertaste.

## Other
### IBU
* This is a measure of the actual bitterness of a beer as contributed by the alpha acid from hops. 
* Because the apparent bitterness of a beer is subjective to the taste of the drinker and the balancing malt sweetness of the beer this is not always an accurate measure of the "hoppiness" of a beer. 
* But, generally speaking, beers with IBUs of less than 20 have little to no apparent hops presence. Beers with IBUs from 20 to 45 are the most common and have mild to pronounced hops presence. Beers with IBUs greater than 45 are heavily hopped and can be quite bitter.
