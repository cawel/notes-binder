## Citrus greening disease
* a disease that sours oranges and leaves them half green, already ravaging citrus crops across the world
* Citrus greening has long affected crops in Southeast Asia, but only in the last decade has the disease spread to the world’s top orange-producing countries, the United States and Brazil.
* C. liberibacter, the bacterium that kills citrus trees by choking off their flow of nutrients — first detected when it destroyed citrus trees more than a century ago in China — had earned a place, along with anthrax and the Ebola virus, on the Agriculture Department’s list of potential agents of bioterrorism. 
* Asian citrus psyllids, the insects that suck the bacteria out of one tree and inject them into another as they feed on the sap of their leaves, can carry the germ a mile without stopping, and the females can lay up to 800 eggs in their one-month life.

## Florida stats
* Florida is the second-largest producer of orange juice in the world, behind Brazil.
* Southern Gardens, a subsidiary of U.S. Sugar, was one of the few companies in the industry with the wherewithal to finance the development of a “transgenic” tree, which could take a decade and cost as much as $20 million.

## GMO critics
* Critics worry that such crops carry risks not yet detected, and distrust the big agrochemical companies that have produced the few in wide use.
* And hostility toward the technology, long ingrained in Europe, has deepened recently among Americans as organic food advocates, environmentalists and others have made opposition to it a pillar of a growing movement for healthier and ethical food choices.
* Zambia, for instance, declined shipments of G.M.O. corn even during a 2002 famine.

## Human influence
* Before humans were involved, corn was a wild grass, tomatoes were tiny, carrots were only rarely orange and dairy cows produced little milk. 

## The orange
* The orange, for its part, might never have existed had human migration not brought together the grapefruit-size pomelo from the tropics and the diminutive mandarin from a temperate zone thousands of years ago in China. 
* And it would not have become the most widely planted fruit tree had human traders not carried it across the globe.
* only 2 varieties of oranges in Florida:
  * the Hamlin, whose unremarkable taste and pale color are offset by its prolific yield in the early season, 
  * the dark, flavorful, late-season Valencia.

## GMO products today
* The genetically modified foods Americans have eaten for more than a decade — corn, soybeans, some cottonseed oil, canola oil and sugar — come mostly as invisible ingredients in processed foods like cereal, salad dressing and tortilla chips.
* a few G.M.O.’s sold in produce aisles — a Hawaiian papaya, some squash, a fraction of sweet corn

### Soybeans
* Nearly all soybeans grown in the United States are now engineered to tolerate an herbicide called glyphosate, allowing farmers to spray it on weeds without harming the crop. 
* Glyphosate kills plants by shutting off an enzyme that most plants need to live. 
* Monsanto produced soybeans that can tolerate the herbicide by giving them a different form of the enzyme that glyphosate does not inhibit. 
* Because of its widespread use over time, some weeds have evolved resistance to glyphosate, and soybeans engineered to tolerate other herbicides have been developed.

### Corn
* Bacillus thuringiensis, a common soil bacterium known as Bt, produces proteins that kill insects that ingest them. 
* Not toxic to humans, such proteins have long been used by organic farmers as natural insecticides. 
* Most corn used for processed foods and animal feed over the last decade has been modified — by Monsanto, Syngenta or other biotechnology firms — to make the Bt proteins, reducing insect damage without the need to spray. 
* Very little of the sweet corn Americans find in the produce aisle or at farm stands is modified, however, in part because of concern among farmers that consumers would not want to buy it.

### Apple
* A Canadian apple grower, Okanagan Specialty Fruits, modified Granny Smith and Golden Delicious apples by inserting an extra copy of the genes that control browning, effectively switching them off. 
* The idea is to reduce waste and increase sales by allowing apples to be sold already sliced. 
* The company is awaiting permission from the Agriculture Department to grow them for commercial production.

### rice
* Known as “golden rice” because of its yellow color, a variety of rice has been modified with genes from maize and a common soil bacteria that together produce rice with beta carotene, which the human body needs to make vitamin A. 
* The lack of the vitamin causes blindness in hundreds of thousands of children in Asia and Africa each year. 
* After more than a decade in development by several nonprofit organizations, tests recently showed that a bowl of the rice can supply 60 percent of a child’s daily requirement of vitamin A. 
* The rice is in a field trial in the Philippines, where it will be tested it for health and environmental safety.

## Monsanto
* It had not helped win hearts and minds for G.M.O.’s, that the first such crop widely adopted by farmers was the soybean engineered by Monsanto with a bacteria gene — to tolerate a weed killer Monsanto also made.
* Starting in the mid-1990s, soybean farmers in the United States overwhelmingly adopted that variety of the crop, which made it easier for them to control weeds. 
* But the subsequent broader use of the chemical — along with a distaste for Monsanto’s aggressive business tactics and a growing suspicion of a food system driven by corporate profits — combined to forge a consumer backlash.
