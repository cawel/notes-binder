# The Story of India: The Power of Ideas

## The Cast System
* system in which all Hindus are born, marry and die
* it fixes their jobs and places in society
* lasted for thousands of years

## 5 elements
* fire
* water 
* air 
* earth
* ether

## Order in society was dicted by the ritual universe
* so it was with society in the 5th century BC:
  * know your place in the order
  * perform the necessary rituals
  * fulfil your duty whatever cast you're born into

## Birth of conscience in the 5th century BC
* putting ethics at the centre of the world, e.g.:
  * China: Confucius and Laozi
  * Mediterranea: Greek philosophers
  * Israel: old Testament prophets

## Buddha
* came from a world of magnificence
* high cast, he had everything
* he left behind wife and family, set out on the road, seeking truth
* 6 years he wandered until he reached Bodh Gaya in North East India (most important of the main 4 pilgrimage sites related to the life of Gautama Buddha)
* today nearly 400 million people are Buddhist (many in Burma, Korea, China)
* Buddhism is the 4th 'religion' in numbers (after Christianity, Islam, and secular/agnostic/atheist adherents)

## 4 noble truths of Buddhism:
* the nature of the human condition is suffering
* suffering is caused by human desire, by attachment
* in the inner life, and in the outside world, free yourself from these desires, and you can become a liberated human being
* but it can only come from within

## Dalai Lama's words
* ultimately, inner happiness, inner satisfaction, must be created by one's self
* as a human being, these inner human values are essential, in order to have a happier life, happier society, happier nation

## More on Buddha
* the core of Buddhist ideas: respect for living things, compassion, truth, non-violence, ethical action
* all versions agree that his last words were these: all created things must pass, strive on diligently

## Buddha's legacy
* the Buddhist ideas remained *local* to the Ganges plain 200 years after his death

## Alexander the Great
* the catalyst for change was war
* 331 BC: greatest battle of Antiquity (between Alexander the Great and Darius)
* the victory of Alexander the Great at the battle of Gaugamela on the Persian plains was a decisive conquest that insured the defeat of his Persian rival King Darius III
* war waged between the Persian Empire and an army led by 25-year old Alexander the Great

## The Maurya Empire
* Chandragupta Maurya is the founder of the Maurya Empire (4th century BC)
* he succeeded in conquering almost all of the Indian subcontinent (fighting Alexander the Great's successors)
* the Maurya Empire is considered the first unifier of India as well as its first genuine emperor
* Chandragupta Maurya brought secular ideas to politics

## Maurya Dynasty
* Chandragupta Maurya's grand son, Ashoka, mixed the secular ideas with the Buddhist ideas
* towards the end of his life, he embraced non-violence
* Buddha was his moral authority

## Animal rights
* India had the first animals rights in the world
* India has the oldest animals hospital in the world
* Ashoka understood that if you are cruel to animals, you will be cruel to human beings
* since animals can't do anything back to you, you can be your true self

## The Axis Age
* the Axial Age or Axial Period is a term coined by German philosopher Karl Jaspers 
* it describes the period from 800 to 200 BC, during which, according to Jaspers, similar revolutionary thinking appeared in Persia, India, China and the Occident. 
* the period is also sometimes referred to as the Axis Age
* there were many empires of the sword, but only India created an empire of ideas
* Ashoka thought that Indians must respect all religions, since they all have the same goal: enlightenment
* he promoted many ideas: compassion, right conduct, non-violence, which became the core of personal morality and the core of politics
* it's moving the sphere of politics away from the sanctions of religion and magic to the rule of reason and morality
* on the Indian flag (created for India's independence), we find Ashoka's wheel of law
