# The Story of India: The Power of Ideas

## The Cast System
* system in which all Hindus are born, marry and die
* it fixes their jobs and places in society
* lasted for thousands of years

## 5 elements
* five elements formed a basis of analysis in Hinduism
  * fire
  * water 
  * air 
  * earth
  * ether (that which was beyond the material world)
* the 5th element is specific to Hinduism
* in Buddhism the 4 great elements, are not viewed as substances, but as categories of sensory experience.

## Order in society was dicted by the ritual universe
* so it was with society in the 5th century BC:
  * know your place in the order
  * perform the necessary rituals
  * fulfil your duty whatever cast you're born into

## Birth of conscience during 5th century BC
* putting ethics at the centre of the world, e.g.:
  * China: Confucius and Laozi
  * Mediterranea: Greek philosophers
  * Israel: old Testament prophets

## Gautama Buddha
* he came from a world of magnificence
* high cast, he had everything
* he left behind wife and family, set out on the road, seeking truth
* 6 years he wandered until he reached Bodh Gaya in North East India (most important of the main 4 pilgrimage sites related to the life of Gautama Buddha)
* all versions agree that his last words were these: all created things must pass, strive on diligently
* the Buddhist ideas remained *local* to the Ganges plain 200 years after his death

## Buddhism
* today nearly 400 million people are Buddhist (many in Burma, Korea, China)
* Buddhism is the 4th "religion" in terms of numbers (after Christianity, Islam, and secular/agnostic/atheist adherents)
* the core of Buddhist ideas: respect for living things, compassion, truth, non-violence, ethical action

### 4 noble truths of Buddhism:
* the nature of the human condition is suffering
* suffering is caused by human desire, by attachment
* in the inner life, and in the outside world, free yourself from these desires, and you can become a liberated human being
* but it can only come from within

### Dalai Lama's words
* ultimately, inner happiness, inner satisfaction, must be created by one's self
* as a human being, these inner human values are essential, in order to have a happier life, happier society, happier nation

## Alexander the Great
* the catalyst for change was war
* 331 BC: greatest battle of Antiquity (between Alexander the Great and Darius)
* the victory of Alexander the Great at the battle of Gaugamela on the Persian plains was a decisive conquest that insured the defeat of his Persian rival King Darius III
* war waged between the Persian Empire and an army led by 25-year old Alexander the Great

## The Maurya Empire
* Chandragupta Maurya is the founder of the Maurya Empire (4th century BC) or the Maurya dynasty
* he succeeded in conquering almost all of the Indian subcontinent (fighting Alexander the Great's successors)
* the Maurya Empire is considered the first unifier of India as well as its first genuine emperor
* Chandragupta Maurya brought secular ideas to politics

### Ashoka
* Chandragupta Maurya's grand son, Ashoka, mixed the secular ideas with the Buddhist ideas
* Buddha was his moral authority
* towards the end of his life, he embraced non-violence
* there were many empires of the sword, but only India created an empire of ideas
* Ashoka thought that Indians must respect all religions, since they all have the same goal: enlightenment
* he promoted many ideas: compassion, right conduct, non-violence, which became the core of personal morality and the core of politics
* it's moving the sphere of politics away from the sanctions of religion and magic to the rule of reason and morality
* on the Indian flag (created for India's independence), we find Ashoka's wheel of law

## Animal rights
* India had the first animals rights in the world
* India has the oldest animals hospital in the world
* Ashoka understood that if you are cruel to animals, you will be cruel to human beings
* since animals can't do anything back to you, you can be your true self

## The Axis Age
* the Axial Age or Axial Period is a term coined by German philosopher Karl Jaspers 
* period from 800 to 200 BC
* Jaspers identified a number of key Axial Age thinkers as having had a profound influence on future philosophies and religions
* Jaspers argued that during the Axial Age the spiritual foundations of humanity were laid simultaneously and independently in China, India, Persia, Judea, and Greece.
* Jaspers saw in the developments in religion and philosophy a striking parallel without any obvious direct transmission of ideas from one region to the other
