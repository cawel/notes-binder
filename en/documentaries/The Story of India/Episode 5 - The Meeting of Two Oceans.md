## The Clash between Island and Hindu
* historian Al Biruni (who was no fan of Mahmoud) said:
* 12 great plundering expeditions engendered a hatred among Hindus for the Turks (the Muslims)
* but what appears to be a clash of civilizations will become over time one of the most remarkable cultural crossovers in the history of civilization
* it will later be called by a great Indian prince "the meeting of two oceans"
* today Indian has half of the world's Muslims

## Military conquests
* 1192 came a new phase : military conquest
* Afghans and Turks became Sultans of Delhi
* they built a giant minaret, Qutab Minar, "the might of Islam", a statement of conquest
* the dynasties of Sultans of Delhi ruled for 300 years
* Islam could not possibly convert India
* they had to co-exist
