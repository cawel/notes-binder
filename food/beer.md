# Beers

## Lager
* a beer brewed by slow fermentation and matured under refrigeration
* Lager (German: storage) is a type of beer that is fermented and conditioned at low temperatures
* Pale lager is the most widely-consumed and commercially available style of beer in the world. 
* Bock, Pilsner, Dortmunder Export and MÃ¤rzen are all styles of lager
* There are also dark lagers, such as Dunkel and Schwarzbier. 

### Pale Lager
* The brewing process for this beer developed in the mid 19th century when Gabriel Sedlmayr took pale ale brewing techniques back to the Spaten Brewery in Germany and applied it to existing lagering brewing methods. 
* This approach was picked up by other brewers, most notably Josef Groll who produced Pilsner Urquell. 
* The resulting pale coloured, lean and stable beers were very successful and gradually spread around the globe to become the most common form of beer consumed in the world today
* The main elements of the lagering method used by Sedlmayr and Groll are still used today, and depend on a slow acting yeast (Saccharomyces pastorianus) that ferments at a low temperature while being stored. Indeed, the German term 'Lager' means 'storage'.
* The resulting pale coloured, lean and stable beers were very successful and gradually spread around the globe to become the most common form of beer consumed in the world today, and includes the American beer Budweiser, the world's highest volume selling beer.

## Ale
* an alcoholic beverage brewed especially by rapid fermentation from an infusion of malt with the addition of hops 
* Ale is a type of beer brewed from malted barley using a warm-fermentation with a strain of brewers' yeast.
* The yeast will ferment the beer quickly, giving it a sweet, full bodied and fruity taste. 
* Most ales contain hops, which help preserve the beer and impart a bitter herbal flavour that balances the sweetness of the malt.
* varieties of ale: brown ale, pale ale, scotch ale, mild ale, burton ale, old ale, belgium ale

### Pale Ale
* The higher proportion of pale malts results in a lighter colour.
* The term "pale ale" was being applied around 1703 for beers made from malts dried with coke (a fuel with few impurities and a high carbon content), which resulted in a lighter colour than other beers popular at that time. 
* Different brewing practices and hop levels have resulted in a range of taste and strength within the pale ale family.

### IPA
* India Pale Ale or IPA is a style of pale ale developed in England for export to India. 
* The first known use of the expression "India pale ale" is in an advertisement in the Liverpool Mercury (a newspaper) of January 30, 1835.
* India Pale Ale or IPA is a beer style within the broader category of pale ale.
* East Coast IPAs are distinguished from West Coast IPAs by a stronger malt presence which balances the intensity of the hops whereas the latter foreground the hops more, possibly because of the proximity of West Coast breweries to hop fields in the Pacific Northwest. East Coast breweries rely more on spicier European hops and specialty malts than those on the West Coast.

## Belgium Ales
* Trappist beers are brewed under direct control of the monks themselves. Of the 171 Trappist monasteries throughout the world, only seven brew beer, of which there are six in Belgium. The seventh is in the Netherlands. Abbey beer is brewed by commercial breweries in the style of a trappist beer, sometimes using the name of a monastery, often one that no longer exists or in some cases one that has licensed its name to a brewery.
