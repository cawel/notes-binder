# From Conquest to Colonialism

## transforming their conquest into colonies
* chaos ensued after conquest
* rapid population declined in the New World
* internal feuding amongst the Conquistadors

## Spain
* controversy over the ethics of the conquest itself
* whether the Europeans have the right to enslave Indians

## Bartolomé de las Casas
* he was a witness of a great deal of violence and exploitation on Hispaniola and later on the main land
* he wrote a treatise which is perhaps the most famous book ever written in the New World
* he argued that Indians had souls, and as God's creatures, they could not be enslaved
as innocents, they could not be enslaved
* consequences: it led to legalize the conquest itself, but to forbid the enslavement of the Indians
* it will influence future doctrines of human rights

## The works of Fray Bartolomé de Las Casas and the debate in Valladolid led the Spanish Crown to
* forbid the enslavement of Indians
* declare that the purpose of the conquest was to convert the Indians to the Christian faith

## Experiments on how to create colonies
* 16th to 18th centuries saw a series of experiments
* English had experimented in Ireland
* Spanish had experimented in the south of Spain, in Andalusia, and the Atlantic islands
* Portuguese had experimented in North Africa and in the Azores

## A Process of negotiation and amalgamation
* from the bottom of the incumbent structure, Europeans would graft on to a new model of statehood beginning with viceroys, judges
* an amalgamation of what was there before with what Europeans introduced

## Tupac Amaru
* the last Incan head of state
* execution in 1572
* example of European violence

## New Spain and the Andes
* presence of elaborate institutions infrastructure of incumbent state

## New France
* no such elaborate state structures
* Woodlands

## Why is the compromise inside the process of colonization so important?
* either way (New France or New Spain) they were negotiated and amalgamated systems
* in order to rebalance their relationship with Asia, Europeans needed stability
* Europeans discovered that the key was to produce and reproduce a system bent to their needs (resources)
* colonies as a source of wealth
* this shift from conquest to colonization is a turning point in world history
